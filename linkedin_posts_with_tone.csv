https://www.linkedin.com/in/aarongolbin/,"Founders keep telling me they’re “too early” for VCs 👀 

But more often than not, it’s not the stage that’s the problem — it’s the story.

Investors don’t need millions in revenue.
We need to believe you’re the one to build something big.

When Airbnb was pitching, most investors passed.
The idea sounded niche. Couch-surfing for conferences? Really?

But they reframed it:
“People are already doing this — they’re just doing it in untrustworthy, fragmented ways. We’re building the trusted platform.”

They showed a vision that was WAY bigger than a few air mattresses.
They made the early traction feel inevitable.
They made the pain point obvious.

Suddenly, the “too early” startup became a rocketship 🚀 

Here’s the truth:
You’re not too early.
You just haven’t told a story that makes your future feel inevitable.

If you’re a founder in that zone, I want to hear your pitch.
Even if you only have 20 users.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/aarongolbin/,"Cold outreach to VCs and angel investors can be a strategic move for startups seeking investment. While it may seem daunting to reach out to potential investors without a prior connection, the benefits can outweigh the initial discomfort. 

Here are several advantages of cold emailing VCs and angel investors:

Access to Capital: One of the most obvious benefits is access to capital. VCs and angel investors are always on the lookout for promising startups to invest in. By cold emailing them, you're putting your startup on their radar and opening up the possibility of securing funding that could be crucial for your company's growth.

Expand Your 
hashtag
#Network: Even if the investor you email doesn't end up investing in your startup, they may still offer valuable feedback, introductions to other 
hashtag
#investors, or advice on how to improve your pitch. Building relationships with investors can also lead to future opportunities and partnerships.

Efficiency: Cold outreach allows you to reach a large number of potential investors quickly and efficiently. While networking events and warm introductions can also be valuable, they often require more time and effort to organize. Cold emailing/messaging allows you to make your pitch to multiple investors simultaneously, increasing your chances of getting a positive response.

LinkedIn as a Tool: 
hashtag
#LinkedIn can be an effective tool for researching potential investors and personalizing your cold emails. By studying an 
hashtag
#investor's profile, you can learn about their investment interests, portfolio companies, and any shared connections you may have. This information can help you tailor your pitch to resonate with the investor and increase the likelihood of a positive response.

Control over the Narrative: When cold emailing investors, you have control over the narrative of your pitch. You can carefully craft your message to highlight your startup's unique value proposition, market potential, and traction. This allows you to present your company in the best possible light and make a compelling case for why the investor should take a closer look.

Practice Pitching: Cold emailing investors provides an opportunity to practice and refine your pitch. As you reach out to different investors and receive feedback, you'll learn what resonates with them and how to effectively communicate the value of your 
hashtag
#startup. This experience will serve you well not only in fundraising but also in other aspects of growing your 
hashtag
#business, such as 
hashtag
#sales and 
hashtag
#marketing.

In summary, cold emailing 
hashtag
#VCs and 
hashtag
#angelinvestors can be a valuable strategy for startups looking to secure investment. By leveraging platforms like LinkedIn and carefully crafting your 
hashtag
#pitch, you can expand your network, access capital, and increase your chances of success.

The week was filed with a ton of unforeseen issues. However that's why we are running beta, to ensure these issues are ironed out before the public market can get their hands on our product.

Here's some takeaways from a week of behind the scenes chaos:

1. ALWAYS battle test your product before going live.

2. There will always be unforeseen issues.

3. Your ideal customer journey is defined by your customers.

4. Timelines are never exactly how you planned.

5. Customers never behave as you expect them to, so over communicate the process initially.

6. ALWAYS hire top down even as a start up. Find ways to acquire the talent you need from the start.

The journey has been grueling yet rewarding in every way. Without the struggle there would be no value in the process. 

If you're new to the startup world. Keep going. Take the lessons and use that experience to drive your vision forward.

Ich bin der Meinung wir sollten langsam beginnen über die Euphorie der Technologie hinauszudenken und den Menschen und die Unternehmensziele ins Zentrum rücken. Es geht darum, eine ganzheitliche Perspektive einzunehmen, die eine Balance aus technologischen Möglichkeiten und den weiteren Konsequenzen der Nutzung mit sich bringt. Ich kann aus den bisherigen Projekten folgende Learnings empfehlen:

𝟏. 𝐌𝐢𝐭 𝐝𝐞𝐦 𝐄𝐧𝐝𝐞 𝐢𝐦 𝐊𝐨𝐩𝐟 𝐛𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐧𝐞𝐧:
Organisationen müssen herausfinden, wie Mitarbeiter nach der Automatisierung routinemäßiger Aufgaben durch KI Mehrwert schaffen können. Man sollte sich frühzeitig überlegen, wie und womit Rollen neu angereichert werden, wenn KI voll autonom läuft.

𝟐. 𝐀𝐮𝐟 𝐎𝐮𝐭𝐩𝐮𝐭 𝐤𝐨𝐧𝐳𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐧:
Um die Produktivitätsvorteile mit KI zu maximieren, sollten Organisationen den Output statt den Input belohnen. Es geht nicht darum wer wie viel mit KI arbeitet, sondern wie gut der Output ist und ob sich dieser an der KI Governance orientiert. Dazu bedarf es einem Upskilling der (zukünftigen) KI-Nutzer.

𝟑. 𝐌𝐞𝐧𝐬𝐜𝐡𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐡𝐞 𝐅𝐚̈𝐡𝐢𝐠𝐤𝐞𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐧 𝐚𝐮𝐬𝐛𝐚𝐮𝐞𝐧:
Die Zukunftssicherung der Belegschaft erfordert die Betonung von Fähigkeiten, die KI einfach nicht ersetzen kann, wie emotionale Intelligenz, Selbstreflexion aber auch Neugier. Es Mitarbeitern zu ermöglichen sich mehr auf den Ausbau der eigenen Fähigkeiten zu konzentrieren, macht die gesamte Organisation besser und die Menschen noch zufriedener.

𝟒. 𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐞 𝐞𝐢𝐧𝐟𝐮̈𝐡𝐫𝐞𝐧:
Eine Kultur des Experimentierens sollte gefördert werden, um schnell auf Veränderungen zu reagieren und kontinuierlich zu lernen. Dies ermöglicht es Organisationen, neue Ideen zu testen und anzupassen, um wettbewerbsfähig zu bleiben. 

𝟓. 𝐄𝐢𝐧 𝐌𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐬𝐞𝐭 𝐟𝐮̈𝐫 𝐖𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐬𝐭𝐮𝐦 𝐰𝐞𝐜𝐤𝐞𝐧:
Um exponentielles Wachstum zu erreichen, ist es entscheidend, die Denkweise zu ändern und bereit zu sein, die Organisation neu zu erfinden. Dies erfordert die Bereitschaft, außerhalb der gewohnten Bahnen zu denken und sich auf transformative Veränderungen einzulassen.

𝟔. 𝐒𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐢𝐬𝐜𝐡 𝐮̈𝐛𝐞𝐫 𝐝𝐢𝐞 𝐞𝐢𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐧 𝐆𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐳𝐞𝐧 𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐮𝐬 𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐤𝐞𝐧:
KI kann - je nach Art der Lösung - über die eigenen Grenzen hinaus genutzt werden. Projekte und andere Formen der Interaktion können mit einer zentralen KI für alle Beteiligten (Lieferanten, Partner, Kunden und sonst. Stakeholder) zu einem kompletten Ökosystem transformiert werden. 

𝟕. 𝐊𝐨𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐧 𝐢𝐦 𝐁𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐤 𝐡𝐚𝐛𝐞𝐧:
Nur wenige Unternehmen haben sich bisher darüber Gedanken gemacht, was die intensive Nutzung von KI eines jeden Mitarbeiters für die Gesamtkosten bedeutet. KI-Anbieter sollten daher auf ihre Fähigkeit der Kostenoptimierung bei den Tokens geprüft werden, sonst gibt es ggf. ein böses Erwachen. 

Wer hat neben Guten bereits schlechte Erfahrungen gemacht?

OpenAI hat das neue KI-Modell o1 veröffentlicht, das signifikante Verbesserungen in Geschwindigkeit, Vielseitigkeit und Präzision bietet. Parallel dazu wurde das Premium-Abonnement ChatGPT Pro für 200 US-Dollar pro Monat vorgestellt, das unbegrenzten Zugang zur Pro-Version des Modells o1 bietet. Dieses richtet sich vor allem an professionelle Anwender wie Forscher, Ingenieure und Entwickler.

Das o1-Modell zeigt deutliche Fortschritte bei komplexen Aufgaben wie Mathematik, Programmierung und wissenschaftlichen Analysen. Die Halluzinationsrate wurde reduziert, während die Genauigkeit, durch “Chain-of-Thought”-Training, verbessert wurde.

Zwei Dinge sind hier wichtig: 
1. OpenAI erwartet für dieses Jahr Verluste in Höhe von etwa fünf Milliarden US-Dollar, während die Einnahmen auf 3,7 Milliarden Dollar geschätzt werden, was mit den massiven Trainingskosten zusammen hängt.
2. Allein der Betrieb von ChatGPT kostet OpenAI Berichten zufolge bis zu 700.000 US-Dollar pro Tag. Bei intensiver Nutzung eines LLMs, dass mit einem Prompt auf alle Unternehmensdaten zugreift und bei tiefer Analyse und Ausgabe der Daten durchaus 100.000 Tokens pro Prompt verbraucht, kann man sich vorstellen, dass 20 Dollar p.M. niemals ausreichen, um ein profitables Unternehmen zu werden.

Was heißt das? Open AI denkt sogar über Ads nach - denn am Ende wollen die Shareholder positives EBITDA.

Seit es bei Perplexity im Feed auch “curated news” gibt, bindet mich das auch über die Suche hinaus an die Seite/App. Die Artikel sind - stand heute - okay.

Ich habe vor kurzem mit einigen führenden Unternehmern im Bereich Deep Learning über KI Agenten gesprochen. Ich fand Jarvis und Friday, aus Iron Man, schon immer cool - aber klar, mehr Vision als Realität.

Man denke in dieser Form an eine persönliche KI-Assistenz, die uns gut kennt - durch Telefongespräche, E-Mails über Gespräche bis hin zur täglichen Umgebung von und über uns lernt.

Dieser private Co-Pilot könnte Assistent, kognitiver Mitarbeiter, Forscher, Coach und Berater sein, der die eigene Produktivität aber auch das persönliche Wachstum in schwindelerregende Höhen treibt!

Branchenexperten zufolge wird bis 2028 jeder, beruflich aber auch privat, eigene KI-Co-Piloten haben! Und damit ist nicht die aktuell noch eher ausbaufähige Variante von Microsoft gemeint. 

Datenschutzbedenken? Einer der relevantesten Aspekte um aus Wunsch auch Wirklichkeit werden zu lassen ist die Sicherheit der eigenen Daten. Die muss oberste Priorität haben. 🔒 

Siri, Alexa und Co im Jahr 2028. Erschreckend und begeisternd zugleich. Ich hätte gern meine persönliche Friday, hab aber Bedenken, was das mit meinen sonstigen sozialen Kontakten macht. Brauche ich die dann weniger?

Wer ist abgeschreckt oder auch eher neugierig? 🚀✨

https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertsch%C3%B6ne/,"Wie blicken zwei Top-Unternehmerinnen, eines Luxus-Kaufhauses und eines Beauty-Online-Shops, auf die Zukunft des Einzelhandelshandels?

Darüber wurde am vergangenen Mittwoch, beim Female Executive Summit des Premium Leaders Club, im Herzen Hamburgs, diskutiert. Diana Bruessow, GM Alsterhaus Hamburg GmbH und Anne Zimmermann, MD Niche-Beauty.COM sprachen mit Entscheidungsträgerinnen, C-Level-Managerinnen und Top-Executives der Branche und darüber hinaus zum Thema ""Future of Retail"". Und es gab keinen besseren Ort, um darüber zu diskutieren als das Alsterhaus, ein traditionsreiches Kaufhaus, das Geschichte und Innovation auf faszinierende Weise miteinander verbindet.

Hier meine Top-3-Learnings des Abends

👉 Customer-centricity: Egal ob Online oder Offline, Produkte und Services werden entlang von Kundennutzen und -feedback weiterentwickelt. Dabei sollen innovative Produktkonzepte, kundenindividuelle Angebote (wie Personal Fitting) und natürlich Premium-Qualität die Value-Proposition stärken. 

👉 Nachhaltigkeit im Fokus: Sowohl beim Betreiben eines Shops als auch in einer physischen Location. Dies erstreckt sich auch auf die Auswahl der Partner und Lieferanten. Gleichzeitig gibt es für alle Beteiligten, egal ob Lieferant, Anbieter oder auch Kunde, noch viel zu lernen und zu tun.

👉 HR-Teams im Spannungsfeld: Ob neue Hirings oder die Erweiterung der Fähigkeiten der bestehenden Teams. Angesichts des Tempos und des Ausmaßes von Veränderung und Disruption, der sich die Einzelhandelsbranche gegenübersieht, müssen Unternehmen und ihre Mitarbeiter zunehmend agiler und proaktiver werden, um die für den Wettbewerb notwendigen Fähigkeiten zu erkennen und zu entwickeln.

Ein besonderer Dank an Alisa Türck, die den Abend begleitet und das Panel auf unnachahmliche Weise moderiert hat.

hashtag
#HappyBirthdayHeidi. Es ist Relegation und ich (natürlich) HSV-Fan. Sport bietet immer großartige Brücken in die Arbeitswelt. Als Stratege interessiere ich mich nicht nur für das Ergebnis auf dem Spielfeld, sondern auch für die Parallelen, die sich zwischen solchen spannenden sportlichen Situationen und der Arbeitswelt ziehen lassen. Und die sind einfach und klar zu finden.

➡ Die Bedeutung des Teamgeistes:
Egal ob auf dem Spielfeld oder im Büro, der Teamgeist spielt eine entscheidende Rolle für den Erfolg. Spieler müssen als Einheit agieren, sich aufeinander verlassen können und gemeinsame Ziele verfolgen. In der Arbeitswelt ist es ähnlich. 
hashtag
#culture 
➡ Mentale Stärke und Resilienz:
In einem Spiel wie der Relegation stehen die Spieler unter enormem Druck. Sie müssen mit Rückschlägen umgehen, Nerven bewahren und schnell auf unvorhergesehene Situationen reagieren. Diese Fähigkeiten sind auch in der Arbeitswelt von großer Bedeutung. Die Fähigkeit, resilient zu sein und sich von Rückschlägen nicht entmutigen zu lassen, ist der Schlüssel zum Erfolg. 
hashtag
#balance
➡ Zielsetzung und Fokus:
Die Jungs haben klare Ziele vor Augen: den Sieg erringen und in einer höheren Liga spielen. Man könnte auch von persönlichem Purpose sprechen. Das erfordert eine klare Zielsetzung und einen starken Fokus auf das Erreichen dieser Ziele. In der Arbeitswelt sollten wir uns ebenfalls klare Ziele setzen und uns darauf fokussieren. Fokus hilft uns, unsere Energie und Ressourcen effektiv einzusetzen und uns nicht von unwichtigen Dingen ablenken zu lassen. 
hashtag
#flow
➡ Lernen aus Niederlagen:
Nicht immer kann man als Sieger aus einem Spiel oder einer Situation hervorgehen. Niederlagen gehören zum Sport und zur Arbeitswelt gleichermaßen dazu. Es geht darum, aus Fehlern zu lernen, sich weiterzuentwickeln und gestärkt aus Rückschlägen hervorzugehen. 
hashtag
#iteration

Fazit:
Wir sind alle Corporate Athletes und können ganz einfach vom Sport lernen.

Die Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters (DTM) ist eine der aufregendsten Motorsportserien der Welt, und am vergangenen Wochenende fand der lang ersehnte Saisonauftakt in Oschersleben statt. Natürlich live begleitet durch ProSiebenSat.1 Media SE und auf Joyn GmbH.
Jeder Zentimeter der Strecke war hart umkämpft, mit dem perfekten Ende und Platz 1 am Samstag für Lamborghini und SSR Performance GmbH. Neben dem persönlichen Austausch mit Fahrern, Team-Chef oder auch dem CTO von Lamborghini, stand auch der Wissenstransfer im Vordergrund. Was kann man von einem High-Performance-Motorsportteam lernen? 
 
➡ Führung und Teamwork: Erfolgreiche Leader im Sport inspirieren und motivieren ihre Teams zur effektiven Zusammenarbeit, um gemeinsame Ziele zu erreichen. 
➡ Effektive Kommunikation: Klare und präzise Kommunikation, auch unter Unsicherheit, als Schlüssel zum Erfolg.
➡ Umgang mit Druck und Stress: Resilienz und ein kühler Kopf helfen, um unter Druck gut zu führen und die richtigen Entscheidungen zu fällen. 
➡ Kontinuierliche Verbesserung: Im Sport wie in der Arbeitswelt fördert dieses Prinzip erst Wachstum.
➡ Agilität: Die Fähigkeit, sich schnell an neue Situationen anzupassen und flexibel zu agieren.
➡ Flow: Arbeiten unter maximalem Fokus, auf den Punkt und völlig in der Aufgabe versunken.

Sicherlich nichts neues. Und dennoch ist es spannend, wie akribisch und fokussiert professionelle Teams arbeiten und welche parallelen es zur ""normalen"" Arbeitswelt gibt.

2015 wurde seitens der United Nations der Aktionsplan „Transformation unserer Welt: die Agenda 2020 für nachhaltige Entwicklung“ ins Leben gerufen. Die 17 SDG habe ich als Grundlage genommen und die Strategie dahingehend entwickelt:

📚hochwertige Bildung
Der PLC hat sich der Aus- und Weiterbildung von Mitarbeitern und Mitgliedern verschrieben. Laufende interne Fortbildungen haben einen ebenso hohen Stellenwert wie der ständige Wissenstransfer. Gelebt wird dieser bei unseren Veranstaltungen – durch den Austausch von Referenten/Experten mit Mitgliedern – sowie in der Premium Leaders University. Unter dem Motto „learn from the best“ haben die Mitglieder die Möglichkeit sich zu vielfältigen Themen fortzubilden

 🙍‍♀️🙎‍♂️Geschlechtergleichheit
Für den PLC sind Vielfalt und Chancengleichheit zentrale Elemente der strategischen Ausrichtung. Jede Mitarbeiterin und jeder Mitarbeiter erhält eine faire Chance, sein/ihr Talent und Potenzial voll zu entfalten und so einen persönlichen Beitrag zum Unternehmenserfolg zu leisten. Als Mitglied der Initiative United Nations WOMEN hat sich der PLC auch den sieben Prinzipien des 
hashtag
#Women’s Empowerment Principles (WEPs) verschrieben (https://lnkd.in/d-8M6xH2) wobei die Gründungspartner die UN Women und United Nations Global Compact sind.

🙏 Menschenwürdige Arbeit & Wirtschaftswachstum
Der PLC legt größten Wert darauf, den 
hashtag
#MitarbeiterInnen ein attraktives Arbeitsumfeld und eine angemessene Vergütung zu bieten. Ziel des PLC ist es, der beste Arbeitgeber in der Branche zu sein und eine Vereinbarkeit von Beruf, Familie und Privatleben zu ermöglichen. Gemessen wird die Zufriedenheit durch regelmäßige Gespräche, um gemeinsam noch besser zu werden.

🤝 Industrie, Innovation und Infrastruktur
Der PLC trägt dafür Sorge, sein Geschäftsmodell langfristig und zukunftsfähig auszurichten. Mit allen Geschäftspartnern wird eine partnerschaftliche Kooperation angestrebt. Zuverlässig und wertschätzend miteinander zu arbeiten, gemeinsam zu wachsen und erfolgreich zu werden, ist für den PLC sehr wichtig. Damit wird ein Beitrag für die Gesellschaft geleistet.

🌳Der PLC kompensiert das Co2 der Autos mit dem ClimatePartner in Deutschland. Wir haben uns für das Klimaschutzprojekt „Bäume pflanzen - Gemeinsam forsten wir Wälder auf“ entschieden. Dabei werden Wälder in Bayern wieder aufgeforstet. Die 
hashtag
#Regionalität ist mir hierbei sehr wichtig.

#Facebook wird Live Shopping abschalten 
 
Nach nur zwei Jahren wird Facebook Live Shopping im Oktober wieder eingestellt. Dann können Händler:innen keine Live-Shopping-Events mehr auf Facebook veranstalten. Es wird jedoch weiterhin möglich sein, Veranstaltungen mit Facebook Live zu übertragen. Das Erstellen von Produkt-Playlists oder das Taggen von Produkten in Facebook Live-Videos wird jedoch nicht mehr möglich sein. Meta begründet diesen Schritt mit der Verlagerung des Schwerpunkts auf Reels.

Zurück zum Alten – Algorithmus Änderungen bei 
hashtag
#Instagram 
 
In den letzten Monaten hat Instagram erhebliche Änderungen an seiner Plattform vorgenommen. Dazu zählte die Algorithmus Änderung, um mehr Empfehlungen und weniger Inhalte von Urheber:innen anzuzeigen, denen die Nutzer:innen bereits folgen. Das führte zu wachsender Kritik in der Community. Instagram will nun die vorgeschlagenen Inhalte wieder herunterfahren, bis der Empfehlungsalgorithmus bessere Ergebnisse liefert. 
Diese Änderungen wirken sich zwar nicht direkt auf die Werbung aus, aber das Nutzererlebnis hat wiederum einen großen Einfluss auf die Anzeigenleistung.

Amazons ""Freevee"" jetzt auch in Deutschland erhältlich 
 
Netflix, Prime Video und Disney+ haben in Deutschland einen Marktanteil von mehr als 80 % bei Video-on-Demand-Diensten. Allerdings konnten Werbetreibende diese Reichweite bisher nicht nutzen, da keiner der großen Dienste in der Vergangenheit für Werbetreibende offen war. Während sowohl Netflix als auch Disney kürzlich Pläne zur Integration von Werbung angekündigt haben, ist

#Amazon nun einen Schritt weiter. Sein werbefinanzierter Video-on-Demand (AVOD)-Dienst ""Freevee"" ist nun auch in Deutschland verfügbar. Auf dem neuen Kanal können Nutzer:innen ausgewählte Filme und Serien streamen - ohne Prime-Mitgliedschaft und ohne Kosten. Wir sind gespannt, wie sich die Reichweite von AVOD-Diensten entwickelt und welche Produktfeatures sie Werbetreibenden bieten werden.

The post's title ""What to do when you want to give up"" suggests that it will provide guidance or motivation to help readers overcome a difficult situation, which is a common theme in inspirational content. The title also implies that the post will offer solutions or advice, which is consistent with an inspirational tone.

Additionally, the title does not contain any humorous or lighthearted language, which rules out ""funny"" as a possible tone. The tone is also not casual or conversational, as it's a professional platform like LinkedIn where users typically expect more formal language.

The lack of specific examples or a list of items (i.e., no ""what to do"" list) also makes a ""listicle"" tone unlikely. The post's focus on providing guidance and motivation to overcome a difficult situation also makes an ""opinion"" tone less likely, as it's more focused on providing helpful advice rather than expressing a personal opinion.

The tone is not ""storytelling"" as there is no narrative or personal anecdote provided in the title. Finally, the tone is not ""professional"" as it's not a formal or technical topic, but rather a motivational one.

You’ve probably seen the video Jaspar Carmichael-Jack posted where he announces he’s stepping down and being replaced by our AI CEO, Jaspar 2.0

(If not, definitely check it out here: https://lnkd.in/dZfZtE_Z)

While many people thought the whole thing was AI generated, it was in fact 100% human made 

We hired an entire film crew, rented a mansion and casted our AI CEO, Tanner McCreary (who is a really human, even if he does look totally AI-generated)

We were up against a lot of constraints:

Timeline = under 3 weeks 
Budget = less than $20k 
Experience = none, apart from one film class I took in 11th grade

(For reference, when we enquired creative agencies, one said it would be $100k+ and they needed at least 3 months to execute it)

We had zero film experience and an impossibly tight turnaround time...

But we ended up delivering a pretty amazing (if I do say so myself) campaign that drove 100,000+ impressions for Artisan

Jaspar even got a few real job offers!

Each tool holds a sliver of the solution, yet none of them work seamlessly together

Humans are stuck in the trenches, manually entering data, toggling between platforms, and spending countless hours on tasks that we can ALREADY automate

It’s a story repeated in every industry, across every vertical—a cycle of inefficiency that wastes millions of human hours and holds society back

This is the problem we’re here to fix

We're building the next generation of software across verticals and industries: AI-first, fully consolidated, and powered by AI Employees—Artisans—at its core

https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaspar-carmichael-jack/,"We got to ~$3M ARR in 5 months with our AI BDR. Here’s how. 

I’ve said before that winning as a startup comes down to 2 things:

1. Product
2. Distribution

We started with a pretty terrible strategy for both…

Our first product sucked - we followed the YC methodology of launching early and iterating. Our MVP didn’t work, the UI was terrible and features were lacking heavily

Though this was a painful process, it enabled us to iterate and build faster than we would have otherwise

We also had no brand awareness, no SEO and no GTM strategy (as you’d expect for a pre-seed startup)

We started with product-led growth, which was a terrible model for us – users never finished onboarding, our ACV was too low, the time-to-value was too long, etc

Think hard about whether product-led is right for you or if you should be doing sales-led

———

We rebuilt our entire strategy to hit $3m ARR in a few months

Product:

We rebuilt everything and launched V2 of our AI BDR, Ava, in May. The relaunch had a completely new UI and features our users had been asking for. We did 100s of user interviews to understand what our users wanted, and built:

- Live lead research across LinkedIn, X, news and the web to create hyper-personalized emails and LI messages

- New data sources to complement our B2B data including E-Commerce and Local Business Data

- Magic Campaigns, so Ava can create your campaign messaging for you 
+ much more

We’re working on a huge release for V4 of Artisan in Q1, so stay tuned 🦄

Distribution:

We built an extremely robust GTM strategy, spanning:

- A comprehensive outbound strategy using Ava, our AI BDR
- Our SF “Stop Hiring Humans” billboard campaign
- Our TechCrunch Disrupt sponsorship
- Ramped up SEO efforts
- Funding announcements combined with big brand pushes 

———

We’re now consistently closing ~$1M of ARR every month and will continue to double down our efforts on building the best product on the market & maintaining our position as a market leader in AI Sales & AI Employees

We have some VERY exciting new products beyond just outbound coming early next year 🤓

https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaspar-carmichael-jack/,"In 3 years there will be no human BDRs.

Ok maybe that's slightly dramatic but there will be significantly less. The role of a BDR has become increasingly automated, but until now, no technology could fully replicate what a human can do. That’s about to change

I've chatted with 100s of BDRs who are excited about Artisan. No BDRs actually want to be BDRs - they want to build human relationships in an AE role

And companies are ready to spend less on their BDR org. For reference, Ava (our AI BDR) costs 90%+ less than the equivalent human output

Traditionally, the BDR role consists of a series of extremely manual tasks:

Build a list of contacts from a B2B data provider
Verify their contact info
Look for personalizations across their LinkedIn, X, news, etc
Prospect through channels like email, phone, or social media
Follow up
Respond to objections
Book in meetings
Update CRM

Automation has been slowly eating away at the BDR’s role for a long time and we're approaching a fully autonomous AI BDR. By 2025, AI BDRs will be list building, prospecting, qualifying over the phone, objection handling, booking meetings, taking notes, and updating CRMs autonomously

Ava already automates 80% of a BDRs role, finding leads, collecting data on from dozens of sources to effectively personalize emails and LinkedIn messages at scale, and managing deliverability

None of our prospects that receive Ava’s emails even realize she’s AI. Ava ghostwrites on behalf of humans

https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaspar-carmichael-jack/,"Your first 5 hires at a startup determine whether it lives or dies. Here are the first hires we made at Artisan that put us on the path to $1M ARR:

1. Engineer
2. Engineer
3. Product Manager
4. Product Designer
5. Chief of Staff

Here’s how each hire played a fundamental role in getting us from 0 to 1:

1 & 2.  Engineer:

Our first product is all-in-one outbound sales platform that consolidates 10s of tools and contains an AI BDR. We couldn’t build that with just one person – we needed more manpower

The first hires we made were engineers (one FE, one BE) and they were instrumental in building our MVP

3. Product Manager:

We’ve always been product obsessed, and every feature we create needs to be 10x better than existing solutions

To help us ensure this, we hired a PM who eventually became my co-founder, Sam!

4. Product Designer:

Most B2B software looks tired We want to create B2B SaaS that feels like using a consumer app

The UI of our MVP was terrible when we first launched it, and we realized how important it was to have a great interface so customers would actually enjoy using the product

We hired a Product Designer so we could create the best UI of any AI SDR tool on the market – and it has made a fundamental difference to our users’ experience

5. Chief of Staff:

Most startups don’t hire a CoS until post Series A. But the value you get from hiring a talented generalist that can do everything is extremely underrated

My CoS Tina was able to take full days of sales calls, create really strong content for our marketing channels & help with hiring demands and expanding our existing team

Now that we’ve hit $1M and are shifting focus to scaling existing processes, we’re looking to hire more drivers (especially engineers) to help us scale to $10M and beyond

Building the right team has enabled us to build the best AI SDR. We have the most comprehensive data, wide-reaching set of features, best personalizations, and an unparalleled user experience

https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaspar-carmichael-jack/,"Artisan has just closed over $700k of ARR in 2 months. This is how I joined the founding team of a hyper-growth startup, without any relevant experience.

I spent a year applying to tech startups without getting any interviews or responses. I knew AI was a field I wanted to go into, but had no idea where to start. I only had ~1 year of experience working in PR, which would hardly make me stand out in a sea of applicants.

Here's what I did in that year, which finally landed me the CoS role at Artisan:

1. Created a list of AI startups that were fast growth, recently raised funding. I checked their job listings religiously.

2. Went to local networking events for founders and startups.

3. Checked the YC job board daily.

4. Used AI in every part of my life and read up on it constantly.

5. Reached out to people I thought were interesting on LinkedIn for coffee chats & insights into the industry.

6. Applied to every open listing that I was remotely interested in.

In December 2023, I got an interview with ElevenLabs. It was the first sign since I started my job hunt that someone was interested. The interviews went well, but as a Series A company, they were looking for someone with way more experience. I was crushed.

In January, I applied to Artisan via their careers form (artisan.co/careers), not expecting to hear back. The next day, Jaspar Carmichael-Jack messaged me to chat.

Here's what I did during the interview process that landed me the job:

1. Phrased my background to justify every step of my journey. I studied English at Oxford (talent for storytelling), went into PR (business operations interest), then moved from healthcare to tech (wanted to contribute to tech's global impact).

2. Was extremely responsive & hard working. I left Saturday plans early for a follow-up interview, spent all of Sunday on my interview task, and worked trial evenings until 12am, after my usual 9 to 5.

3. Excelled at a tough task. Because I lacked experience, I was given a mammoth task to create a website strategy for Artisan's next product launch. I had no idea where to start. GPT was my consultant through the whole process, helping me create a framework from which to work from.

4. Showed confidence in the value I COULD bring, despite my non-traditional background.

Experience shouldn't matter in hiring. Look for intelligence, resourcefulness, scrappiness - qualities for thriving in fast-paced environments. Artisan took a chance on me, which paid off through my rapid growth and dedication.

Build these qualities:
- Resourcefulness
- An insane work ethic
- Perseverance
- Confidence in your value

 and you'll catch someone's eye soon.

Traditional growth channels are dying - startups are burning cash, time, and morale by chasing ghosts.

It doesn't matter how great your marketing is - if no one needs/wants what you're building, you won't close any deals

We ask the right questions in user interviews & sales calls, and feed those insights directly to our roadmap. Our AI BDR Ava is 1% of what our future product is going to be

2. Creating engaging content on LinkedIn

Founder and thought leadership content is our secret weapon

Sharing our journey & wins is a huge channel for us. It's gotten us 1000s of leads and 10s of investors

Awareness spreads like wildfire (and it’s completely free)

3. Using Ava, our own outbound engine

In-depth personalization is key for getting responses from leads, and we're launching a huge update to take this to the next level in a few weeks - learn more about Ava at https://lnkd.in/eAJ28nnS

4. Tapping into the YC network

We're the leading outbound product in the YC ecosystem, and have YC companies turning to us every day to support building their outbound demand generation engine. If you're an early-stage founder with a B2B product with category-leading potential, apply to YC

5. Exploring a number of GTM channels

We've tested too many GTM channels to list here (SEO, blog content, influencer, press, events, etc) and have learned a lot about what works/doesn't work for early stage B2B SaaS companies. If you want me to send you a breakdown of our analysis of different channels, leave a comment below

**Inspirational**

The post has an uplifting and motivational tone, as it celebrates the success of Artisan AI and its founder Jaspar Carmichael-Jack. The language used is enthusiastic and admiring, with words like ""winners"", ""vision"", ""urgency"", and ""respect"" to describe the founder. The author is clearly impressed and excited about the company's achievements, and the post concludes with a message of congratulations and encouragement. The tone is also slightly cautionary, warning those who are not willing to adapt to change, but overall, it's an inspirational and positive message.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaspar-carmichael-jack/,"It was great to speak at the GenAI Summit about the future of AI Employees: Artisans. 

Imagine this:

Your Marketing Artisan sets up a paid ad campaign for you and routes highly targeted customers to a lead generation form. 

Ava, your Sales Rep Artisan deals with the inbound lead and schedules a meeting with one of your AEs. 

Ava joins the meeting, takes notes, lists action points, and guides your AE through the sales pipeline to maximize conversions. 

The client converts, and your Customer Success Artisan has a corpus of context to be able to effectively support them. 

Right now Ava might just be an AI BDR (albeit the best one…), but our vision is about creating an ecosystem of AI Employees and world-class software products. (And even the workflow I broke down above is just the tip of the iceberg 🧑‍🎨)

2. **Visionary language**: The use of phrases like ""our vision is about creating an ecosystem of AI Employees and world-class software products"" suggests a sense of aspiration and ideals, which is typical of an inspirational tone.
3. **Positive and optimistic view**: The post presents a positive and optimistic view of the future of AI Employees, with a focus on collaboration and innovation, which is also consistent with an inspirational tone.

Additionally, the tone is also **professional** to some extent, as the post is on LinkedIn and the language used is formal and polished. However, the inspirational tone is more dominant.

The other options don't quite fit as well:

* **Storytelling**: While the post does use a narrative structure to describe the workflow, it's not a traditional story with a clear beginning, middle, and end.
* **Listicle**: The post doesn't follow a list format, and the content is more descriptive and conversational.
* **Opinion**: While the post expresses the author's opinion on the future of AI Employees, it's not a strongly opinionated piece.
* **Casual**: The language used is formal and polished, which suggests a more professional tone.
* **Funny**: There's no humor or lighthearted tone in the post.
* **Informative**: While the post does provide some information about the concept of AI Employees, it's not primarily an informative piece."

They're on a mission to create an all-in-one platform that consolidates top SaaS products in the go-to-market space, allowing Artisans to automate the majority of work alongside human teams. Ava, their AI BDR launched in February 2023, automates 80% of a BDR's role by consolidating outbound sales tools. Next up is Liam, the Marketing Artisan, and James, the Customer Success Artisan.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaspar-carmichael-jack/,"Very excited to share that I’m joining Artisan as Junior Chief of Staff!

About two months into my first job out of university, AI exploded onto the scene with the release of ChatGPT. At the time it was an interesting novelty, but I doubt many people expected it to impact the way we work and live.

Fast forward to a year later, GenAI is now on everyone’s minds - companies are strategizing about how to best leverage it, organizations are developing AI training programs, and there’s a constant debate about which tools are the best for which use cases. What once seemed like a passing fad is now redefining the professional landscape.

That’s where Artisan comes in - we’re building the world’s first human-like AI employees.

More than just AI tools, Artisans are designed to be digital assistants who work alongside people to automate mundane tasks. We’ve already launched Ava, an outbound sales rep who identifies and emails leads, with very little human input. She’s the first of many to come!

Behind these innovations is an incredible team that's already raised a $3m pre-seed round, secured Y Combinator backing, and hit $150k ARR. 

Looking forward to working alongside Jaspar Carmichael-Jack, Rupert Dodkins, DPhil FRAS, and the rest of the team to bring more Artisans to life!

https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaspar-carmichael-jack/,"7 must-follow SaaS trends in 2024 ⚡ 


1️⃣ Co-pilots and Companions
If we examine Y Combinator’s W2024 Batch, we will find at least a dozen products positioning themselves as 'co-pilots.' Also, big tech companies add copilots as features in their products. For example:
- GitHub has Github Copilot.
- Shopify has Shopify Sidecick.
- HubSpot has ChatSpot.

2️⃣ AI Digital Workers
Similar to copilots, AI digital workers aim to increase a company’s productivity, but their ultimate goal is to either replace or work alongside real-world colleagues, reducing manual work and repetitive tasks.
- AISDR > Hire your first AI SDR.
- Artisan > Out-of-the-box AI digital workers that integrate with human teams.

3️⃣ Generative AI and GPTs
Generative AI will still be a huge trend in 2024, as many SaaS products will continue to add generative AI features to their products.
- Canva has Canva Magic Studio.

4️⃣ SaaS for SaaS
We will see more SaaS products created specifically for other SaaS products, with the end goal of speeding up product development.

Basedash > Connect your database. Get an admin panel.
Hyperline > Seamless billing from quote to cash.
Cord > Chat and notifications in your product.

5️⃣ B2B Creator Economy
More and more companies are collaborating with creators to generate brand awareness, meetings, sales, and revenue. Thus, we will see more people creating B2B content.
- beehiiv > create newsletters.
- blaze > create content faster.

6️⃣ Shifts in B2B sales
Here are the most important ones:
- Intent-Based Prospecting > with tools like LoneScale, LeadsOtter.
- Outbound as a Growth > teams at Ramp, Pigment and Spendesk.
- Sales Tools Consolidation > Clari acquired Groove, HubSpot acquired Clearbit.
- No-Code Prospecting > Rows.com, Clay and Captain Data.
- AI Outreach and AI Emails at Scale > Luna.ai, Persana AI and SellScale.
- AI SDRs and AI Sales Agents > AISDR and Trigify.io.
- Spam, Email Deliverability and Cold Outreach Infrastructure.
- B2B data democratization > FullEnrich and Prospeo.
- Warm intros and partnerships > The Swarm 🔆, Cabal and Reveal.

7️⃣ Category Challengers
We will see more SaaS startups that aim to compete and challenge existing industry leaders across different categories.
- folk and their CRM.
- Durable and their AI website builder.

And it was the tip of the iceberg.

So curious to see the evolution of these trends.
